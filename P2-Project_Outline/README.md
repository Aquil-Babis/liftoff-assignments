# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For this project, my group and I will be developing a portal for students to recieve and submit coursework for the Startland group.  This site should have authentication
for students to login and have their progress tracked as they work through the course.  The submitted work will be in the form of video files and pdf and should be able to
recieve and display these files properly.  The client has also requested a function for fellow students in the program to be able to comment on submitted work.  Our group
also feels there should be authentication for administrators so that instructors can add coursework and anouncements without having to hardcode the information.
	This should make for an easy way for students to find the relevant coursework and submit their assignments as well as for instructors to add or update content within
course.
### Features
Student Log-in: Students should be able to create a unique login.  This login should give them access to coursework, grant the ability to submit assignments, and allow the 
		student to be able to comment on fellow students submissions.
Display Coursework: Coursework should be accessable to valid users in an organized and easily navigatable way.  This should be in the form of modules provided by the client
		    in the form of text and embedded videos.
Submit Assignments: Students should be able to submit assignments as videos or pdf format.  This should show on the students profile to allow for tracking progress and recieving
		    student feedback.
Student Feedback: Fellow students should be able to submit comments on submitted work which should be viewable either in a forum or comments section.

Admin Log-in: An option for administrator privelages should be available to allow for instructors to easily submit announcements or potentially add/update course content.
	      Other admin powers may be considered in the future (curating forums, granting kudos, etc.).
Home Screen: A home screen should be visible after login which shows current assignments due, announcements, and other relevant information.  This screen should update to 
	     show the current user's progress.
